        <div class="subheading mb-5">Neuroscientist 🧠</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Neuroscience, also known as Neural Science, is the study of how the nervous system develops, its structure, and what it does. Neuroscientists focus on the brain and its impact on behavior and cognitive functions. Not only is neuroscience concerned with the normal functioning of the nervous system, but also what happens to the nervous system when people have neurological, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroscience is often referred to in the plural, as neurosciences. Neuroscience has traditionally been classed as a subdivision of biology. These days, it is an interdisciplinary science which liaises closely with other disciplines, such as mathematics, linguistics, engineering, computer science, chemistry, philosophy, psychology, and medicine. Many researchers say that neuroscience means the same as neurobiology. However, neurobiology looks at the biology of the nervous system, while neuroscience refers to anything to do with the nervous system. Neuroscientists are involved in a much wider scope of fields today than before. They study the cellular, functional, evolutionary, computational, molecular, cellular and medical aspects of the nervous system. The major branches in neuroscience today are. Affective neuroscience – in most cases, research is carried out on laboratory animals and looks at how neurons behave in relation to emotions. Behavioral neuroscience – the study of the biological bases of behavior. Looking at how the brain affects behavior. Cellular neuroscience – the study of neurons, including their form and physiological properties at cellular level. Clinical neuroscience – looks at the disorders of the nervous system, while psychiatry, for example, looks at the disorders of the mind. Cognitive neuroscience – the study of higher cognitive functions that exist in humans, and their underlying neural bases. Cognitive neuroscience draws from linguistics, neuroscience, psychology and cognitive science. Cognitive neuroscientists can take two broad directions; behavioral/experimental or computational/modeling, the aim being to understand the nature of cognition from a neural point of view. Computational neuroscience – attempting to understand how brains compute, using computers to simulate and model brain functions, and applying techniques from mathematics, physics and other computational fields to study brain function. Cultural neuroscience – looks at how beliefs, practices and cultural values are shaped by and shape the brain, minds and genes over different periods. Developmental neuroscience – looks at how the nervous system develops on a cellular basis; what underlying mechanisms exist in neural development. Molecular neuroscience – the study of the role of individual molecules in the nervous system. Neuroengineering – using engineering techniques to better understand, replace, repair, or improve neural systems. Neuroimaging – a branch of medical imaging that concentrates on the brain. Neuroimaging is used to diagnose disease and assess the health of the brain. It can also be useful in the study of the brain, how it works, and how different activities affect the brain. Neuroinformatics – integrates data across all areas of neuroscience, to help understand the brain and treat diseases. Neuroinformatics involves acquiring data, sharing, publishing and storing information, analysis, modeling, and simulation. Neurolinguistics – studying what neural mechanisms in the brain control the acquisition, comprehension and utterance of language.<br><br>

        Neurophysiology – looks at the relationship of the brain and its functions, and the sum of the body’s parts and how they interrelate. The study of how the nervous system functions, typically using physiological techniques, such as stimulation with electrodes, light-sensitive channels, or ion- or voltage-sensitive dyes. Paleoneurology – the study of the brain using fossils. Social neuroscience – this is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding how biological systems implement social processes and behavior. Social neuroscience gathers biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior. It uses social and behavioral concepts and data to refine neural organization and function theories. Systems neuroscience – follows the pathways of data flow within the CNS (central nervous system) and tries to define the kinds of processing going on there. It uses that information to explain behavioral functions. However, Neuroscience is an ever changing biological science that tends to bring up new information every melania. In neuroscience research is always conducted in order to solve life threatening brain conditions therefore neuroscience is a field that is always looking for new and fresh youth to look and solve problems from different angles. Although this job has long hours and is very time consuming it brings many advantages. For example the typical annual salary for a neuroscience major can start off anywhere from 400k to 800k depending on the focus of the neuroscience focus, you get to save numerous lives, there's an absolute assurance of job security, find challenges that could create a fond love and enjoyment of the job and lastly becoming an emotional hero to patients along with their families. Studies say that job security and challenges within a work environment create happiness and fulfillment in your everyday life. Along with this comes enjoyment challenges due to the fact that no two cases are the same. A neurosurgeon should enjoy the intellectual challenge of dealing with constant learning and change. A few fun facts about neuroscience is that it’s one of the highest paid jobs, one of the most mentally challenging jobs, involves a lot of  critical thinking along with fast pace steps in order to get the job done in a speedy manner especially when patients' lives depend on it. Although not all neuroscientists have the same title or sub focus they all are relied on to save lives and create cures in a speedy manner. In the brain there are 6 lobes in charge of humans' everyday functions. Simple everyday functions like smiling, picking up a pen, walking, etc is all dependent on the condition your brian is. One small shift, change, or sickness can affect one's ability to do simple tasks. For example, the frontal lobe is incharge of Attention and concentration, Self-monitoring, Organization, Speaking (expressive language), Motor planning and initiation, Awareness of abilities and limitations, Personality, Mental flexibility, Inhibition of behavior Emotions, Problem solving, Planning and anticipation and Judgment. Continuing the Parietal Lobe is in charge of Sense of touch, Spatial perception, Differentiation (identification) of size, shapes, and colors, and Visual perception.<br><br>

        Followingly, the Brain Stem is in charge of Breathing, Arousal and consciousness, Attention and concentration, Heart rate and ones Sleep and wake cycles. The Temporal Lobe is in charge of Memory, Understanding language (receptive language), Sequencing, Hearing, and Organization. Lastly, the Cerebellum Lobe has a focus in Balance, Skilled motor activity, and Coordination. Occipital Lobe Is in charge of one's Vision. However, the right and left hemispheres of the brain have completely different functions. One is focused on precision and detail while the other half is focused on the larger image of life. However with one small injury either side can be damaged or altogether gone forever. A few commonly known brain injuries are Concussion. Concussions, or mild TBIs, are the most frequent brain injury in traumatic accidents. Diffuse Axonal Injury, this type of brain injury is common in car accidents. Lastly, contusion, a contusion within the brain refers to a bruise. A few delays that occur due to brain injuries on the left side of the brain are Difficulties in understanding language (receptive language), Difficulties in speaking or verbal output (expressive language), Catastrophic reactions (depression, anxiety), Verbal memory deficits, Impaired logic, Sequencing difficulties, andDecreased control over right-sided body movements. On the other hand the right side of the brain a few delays that occur due to injuries to the brain are Visual-spatial impairment, Visual memory deficits, Left neglect (inattention to the left side of the body), Decreased awareness of deficits, Altered creativity and music perception, Loss of “the big picture” type of thinking, and Decreased control over left-sided body movements. A few diffuse brain injuries are Reduced thinking speed, Confusion, Reduced attention and concentration, Fatigue and Impaired cognitive (thinking) skills in all areas. As seen above if not noticed before the brain is of largest importance to the whole body. Without a brain then one is incapable of living. Therefore normally when in medical situations if one's brain is unresponsive you are pronounced unresponsive or brain dead or in a vegetable state. It is very uncommon to treat someone who is already medically dead therefore without a brain there is no life. Brain death (also known as brain stem death) is when a person on an artificial life support machine no longer has any brain functions. This means they will not regain consciousness or be able to breathe without support. A person whose brain is dead is legally confirmed as dead. However there are other forms to damage the brain. For instance damaging the brain stem. When doing so one is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe. When this happens, a ventilator keeps the person's heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream. When this occurs there is no chance of recovery. Brain stem death is a difficult concept to grasp and we encourage you to speak to the doctors and nurses about any questions you may have.
